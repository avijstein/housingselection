### Housing Selection Application for Wesleyan University ResLife

Wesleyan University owns over 150 houses for students to live in their senior year, but the information on them is scattered over hundreds of webpages and inconsistent. This project pulled data from each of these webpages, cleaned and organized them into a large dataset. 

This dataset included both listed information, as well as hidden information on the houses, such as ADA code and fire code capacity, and calculated information, such as distances to campus hotspots (e.g. gym, dining halls).

After going through the struggle myself, I created a Shiny app to help Wesleyan students more easily navigate their senior housing options, refining their searches quickly in a matter of minutes, rather than hours of gathering data from scattered webpages. A majority of rising seniors ended up using this tool and found it helpful in their search, according to feedback collected by Wesleyan's ResLife. It was also featured in the Wesleyan student newspaper, the [Argus](http://wesleyanargus.com/2017/04/10/new-website-eases-housing-selection-frustrations/).

Special thanks to Professor Valerie Nazzaro and Professor Robert Kabacoff of Wesleyan's Quantitative Analysis Center for help on this project.
